While I probably could get by with just a style tile, I think that full comps are more practical as they give you something to match when working with HTML and CSS. Each of the tiles took about two hours to do, and the full comp about two hours. As it was my first time using a photo editing program, simple things took a long time to accomplish, but I still feel as though I made something that is achievable with my current skillset of CSS and HTML.
